PASSAGE::: Researchers examining data from the New Horizons space probe, which passed Pluto in 2015, were puzzled by a 27-mile-long crater on Pluto's icy surface. Although Pluto is mostly covered in frozen methane and nitrogen, the surface near the crater seemed to show the presence of water ice and ammonia—both of which are associated with eruptions from ice volcanoes.

PASSAGE::: 
Text 1
In the past, music albums were created to be played back on physical formats like records. A typical record holds only about twenty-five minutes of music on each of its shiny black sides. This forced artists and producers to think carefully about what music to include on an album and what to leave out. Today's artists don't have to worry as much about fitting their music on physical formats. For this reason, many of today's artists are making albums that are much longer than albums from decades past.

Text 2
In today's digital age, most music is created to be streamed from online services. These services remove the limitations of physical formats like records and CDs. This may be why many new albums are longer and have more songs than albums crafted for physical formats. Unfortunately, many of these longer albums suffer from a lack of focus.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Based on the texts, the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about many new albums?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) Many new albums include more artwork than albums generally once included.
OPTION::: B) Many new albums sell more copies than albums generally once sold.

The article describes students reciting the same pledge that Bellamy claims he first wrote in August. This means that Bellamy may not have created the pledge after all.

PASSAGE::: Sheep and macaque monkeys can see in three dimensions (3D), which helps them perceive distance and depth. Octopuses and squid are thought to lack 3D vision.

The team studied how cuttlefish wearing 3D glasses reacted to 3D images of shrimp (a favorite prey) projected on a tank wall. Cuttlefish changed their striking position to match the 3D images, suggesting that their vision is more like that of sheep and macaque monkeys than that of octopuses or squid.

PASSAGE::: The following text is from Anthony Trollope's 1855 novel The Warden. Tom Towers is a writer for the newspaper The Jupiter.
It is true that in far-off provinces men did not talk daily of Tom Towers but they read The Jupiter, and acknowledged that without The Jupiter life was not worth having. This kind of hidden but still conscious glory suited the nature of the man. He loved to sit silent in a corner of his club and listen to the loud chattering of politicians, and to think how they all were in his power;—how he could smite the loudest of them, were it worth his while to raise his pen for such a purpose.

PASSAGE::: Assessing the role of forests as sinks for airborne microplastics that would otherwise continue to disperse in the atmosphere, Akane Miyazaki and her team measured concentrations of plastic particulates on leaves from konara oak trees in Japan. The team used three separate extraction methods: an ultrapure water rinse, a rinse combined with ultrasonic waves, and an alkaline solution treatment that removes epicuticular wax (a surface coating on most land plants to which particles can adhere). The concentrations of particulates recovered were 7.6 percent for water extraction, 38.4 percent for ultrasonic extraction, and 53.8 percent for alkaline extraction, leading the team to conclude that previous assessments have likely underestimated forest canopies' capacity as sinks.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which detail, if true, would most directly support the team's conclusion?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) Most studies of microplastic accumulation on leaves have utilized extraction methods that do not have a substantial effect on epicuticular wax.
OPTION::: B) Most studies of microplastic accumulation on leaves have focused on forests with diverse tree species that exhibit varying levels of epicuticular wax.
OPTION::: C) Most studies of microplastic accumulation on leaves have found particulate concentrations that greatly exceeded 53.8 percent.

PASSAGE::: Esther Samp-Mengual, Kathrin Specht, and their team surveyed three groups of people in Bologna, Italy—leaders of urban agriculture projects, stakeholders in urban agriculture (e.g., food researchers and urban farming associations), and the general public—to compare their views about the extent to which urban agriculture contributes to 25 social or ecological services that the team identified. The researchers used these ratings to rank the services for each group, with a ranking of 1 indicating that a group perceives that urban agriculture benefits that service the most. Using only the rankings shown in the table, a city planner in Bologna who is promoting a new urban agriculture project concludes that advertisements aimed at stakeholders should emphasize the project's benefit to the enhancement of pollination.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which choice best describes data in the table that support the city planner's conclusion?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) The enhancement of pollination was ranked higher for stakeholders than were the other four services.
OPTION::: B) The prevention of soil erosion was ranked lower for stakeholders than it was for project leaders.
OPTION::: C) The enhancement of pollination was ranked higher for the general public than it was for stakeholders.

PASSAGE::: In an international collaboration, Elaine Ostrander, an expert on dog genetics, and other researchers probed the evolutionary history of size variation in modern dogs. Scientific consensus held that early dogs had large body mass and that a genetic driver of smaller size in some breeds (e.g., bulldogs) developed only within the last 20,000 years as a result of selective breeding for characteristics favored by humans. Ostrander et al. assert that this explanation is flawed, having discovered that a mutation responsible for variants of IGF1, a gene found in many mammals that regulates production of insulin-like growth factor 1, is ubiquitous in domestic dog breeds.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' assertion?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) IGF1 has been isolated in genetic material from fossils more than 20,000 years old of the red wolf (Canis rufus) and certain other species related to dogs.
OPTION::: B) An additional mutation related to IGF1 affects the development of characteristics other than body size in smaller dog breeds like bulldogs.
OPTION::: C) The mutation related to IGF1 influences body size and is found in 53,000-year-old genetic material from fossils of Siberian wolves (Canis lupus campestris), an ancestor of dogs.
OPTION::: D) One variant of IGF1 is found only in smaller dog breeds like bulldogs and appears to have emerged no more than 20,000 years ago.

PASSAGE::: Soil thawing in Alaska has been accelerating as a result of climate changes, potentially enabling increased carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption through greater productivity of arctic-bramble (Rubus arcticus) plants and other vegetation, but also potentially enabling increased CO2 output through greater heterotrophic respiration (CO2 generated by the activity of soil microorganisms). Hydrologist Yonghong Yi and her colleagues developed a model incorporating numerous inputs—years of soil temperature and snow cover data among them—to evaluate the effects of climate changes on the CO2 balance in Alaska, concluding that net CO2 is likely to increase if seasonal snow cover arrives earlier relative to the onset of soil surface freezing.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' conclusion?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) The effect of soil temperature on the growth of vegetation and on the rate of heterotrophic respiration is stronger during the period of seasonal snow cover than during the period without snow cover.
OPTION::: B) Relatively early snow cover reduces the amount of soil moisture available for the growth of plant species such as R. arcticus and lowers the rate of heterotrophic respiration.
OPTION::: C) Seasonal snow cover tends to persist longer in areas of relatively low vegetation growth and high heterotrophic respiration than in areas of relatively high vegetation growth and low heterotrophic respiration.
OPTION::: D) The soil insulation provided by snow cover enables heterotrophic respiration to continue during a period in which plants such as R. arcticus are typically not growing.
