PASSAGE::: [UNDERLINE_START]Benjamin Prud'homme and colleagues have explored how convergent evolution—a phenomenon that occurs when the same trait evolves independently in two reproductive separate lineages—can result from a genetic mechanism shared by both lineages.[UNDERLINE_END] Meanwhile, Patricia J. Wittkopp and colleagues have investigated how convergence occurs through different genetic mechanisms, but the relative prevalence of convergence through shared and different genetic processes is still poorly understood.

PASSAGE::: In what is now Washington state, the Tulalip Tribes operate the Hibulb Cultural Center. Relying on traditional knowledge to guide the design of exhibits, this institution presents Tulalip history and culture to the tribes' citizens. The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, a tribe in North Dakota, employs a similar strategy in its own cultural center. Both centers contrast with museums that aren't Indigenous-led; when displaying Indigenous artifacts, such museums tend to anticipate mainly non-Indigenous audiences and rely on Euro-centric strategies for designing exhibits.

OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) It describes how tribal cultural centers designed exhibits of a particular set of artifacts, then analyzes how non-Indigenous institutions designed exhibits of the same artifacts.

PASSAGE::: Text 1
Uisdean Nicholson and his team have discovered evidence in seismic data of a 40-kilometer-wide subsurface crater beneath nearly a kilometer of water off the coast of West Africa that is consistent with a 400-meter-wide asteroid striking the seafloor. This structure, which the team named Nadir, exhibits all the telltale signs of a high-velocity impact crater: an elevated rim, a circular shape, a terraced floor, and a pronounced area of uplift at its center.

Text 2
Both carbonate dissolution and subsurface salt withdrawal can cause craterlike depressions without the need for a high-velocity impact. However, carbonate dissolution is unlikely to have occurred in the vicinity of Nadir, and although subsurface salt withdrawal could have plausibly occurred in this area and would result in a depression with a terraced floor or a circular shape, it would not exhibit the area of central uplift seen at Nadir.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which choice best describes a difference between the approach of Text 1 and the approach of Text 2?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) Text 1 dispassionately describes Nicholson and colleagues' findings and conclusions, whereas Text 2 attempts to convey the researchers' excitement on discovering Nadir.
OPTION::: B) Text 1 focuses on features Nadir lacks, whereas Text 2 indicates features it shares with other geological depressions.
OPTION::: C) Text 1 discusses a single plausible cause for Nadir, whereas Text 2 evaluates two possible causes.
OPTION::: D) Text 1 emphasizes the evidence supporting an asteroid impact as the cause of Nadir, whereas Text 2 argues against that explanation.

PASSAGE::: "Cacao" is an example of a loanword—that is, a word that originated in one language and was later adopted by another. The word came to English indirectly from cacao, the Spanish word for the plant that chocolate is made from. Spanish had borrowed it from Nahuatl, an Indigenous language of Central Mexico, in which the word's original form is cacahuatl. "Puma" is also Indigenous in origin and entered English through Spanish. But in this case, the original source was Quechua, a language of South America, in which the word for the mountain lion is also puma.
QUESTION_TEXT::: The author makes which point about the Spanish language?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) It has served as a medium through which Indigenous languages have influenced English.
OPTION::: B) Its contribution to English vocabulary roughly equals the collective contribution by Indigenous languages.
OPTION::: C) It adopted Nahuatl and Quechua words in approximately equal numbers.
OPTION::: D) It has borrowed words from Indigenous languages and contributed words to them.

PASSAGE::: Motivated to sell as many paintings as possible, Harold Hair, an influential figure among the landscape artists known as the Florida Highwaymen, pioneered "fast painting," which in part involved working across multiple canvasses at once. That many of Hair's acolytes, including Isaac Knight, imitated the technique accounts in part for the impressionistic qualities that are now synonymous with the group's shared aesthetic. But not all Highwaymen fully embraced this approach; for instance, though Willie Reagan was also prolific, his paintings were executed with greater attention to detail.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which choice does the text most strongly suggest about paintings by Knight?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) Because of the manner in which they were created, they likely have visual qualities that are regarded as more typical of Florida Highwaymen paintings than the qualities in works by Reagan are.
OPTION::: B) Although it is evident that Knight adopted some of Hair's preferred techniques, Knight's works are less derivative of works by Hair than is typically acknowledged.
OPTION::: C) The lack of precision with which they were executed suggests that they are inferior to works by either Hair or Reagan.
OPTION::: D) Knight's reliance on the technique of fast painting likely accounts for his works being more aesthetically interesting than works by Reagan are.

PASSAGE::: Veronica L. Bura, Akito Y. Kawahara, and Jayne E. Yack investigated the evolution and function of sound production in silk moth and hawk moth caterpillars. They found that during harmless simulated attacks on isolated caterpillars, 33% of the tested species produced sound, which ranged from clicks in Actias luna to whistles in Rhodinia fugax. Although some insects use sound to communicate with members of the same species, the researchers claim that the caterpillar sounds recorded in their study are directed primarily at predators.

PASSAGE::: Why do rusty-spotted cats purr but jaguars roar? Researchers hypothesize that this difference between the two feline species may be partly due to a U-shaped bone in their throats called the hyoid. Rusty-spotted cats, which are much smaller than jaguars, have a rigid hyoid that rumbles when the cat's larynx vibrates, resulting in a purr. By contrast, jaguars have a somewhat flexible hyoid, and the bone is attached to the skull with a stretchy ligament that rusty-spotted cats lack. These traits allow jaguars and most other species of big cats to produce powerful roars. The same traits may also prevent most big cats from purring.

PASSAGE::: Scholarly interest in literary juvenilia—writings by children and teenagers—tends to focus on unpublished works by authors who became famous as adults, such as Charles Dickens's poem "The Bill of Fare," which he wrote around the ages of 18-20, because they offer insights into their authors' artistic development. But some scholars also argue that recovering juvenilia by lesser-known writers is essential to understanding literary history: Daisy Ashford's novels, which she published as a child, were widely read by contemporaries and are therefore deserving of closer attention.

PASSAGE::: Neurobiologists Laura Cuaya, Raúl Hernández-Pérez, and colleagues investigated the language detection abilities of eighteen dogs. The researchers monitored the brain activity of Kun-kun (a border collie), Bingo (a mixed breed), and other dogs while the animals listened to three recordings: one of The Little Prince being read in Spanish, the second in Hungarian, and a third made up of short, randomly selected fragments of the first two, scrambled so that they didn't resemble human speech. Each dog was familiar with either Spanish or Hungarian, but not both. The team concluded that differences in dogs' anatomical features may affect their ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which finding from the study, if true, would most directly support the team's conclusion?

PASSAGE::: Some climate models for the western United States predict that while total annual precipitation may remain unchanged from the present level, precipitation will become concentrated into fewer but more intense rain and snow events. University of Texas climate scientist Geeta Persad and her colleagues simulated how the amount of water entering aquifers and the amount being used for irrigation purposes would change if this were to occur. Persad and her colleagues concluded that concentration of precipitation into fewer events would result in a higher number of dry days, triggering more irrigation, but that this change in irrigation output is highly sensitive to the baseline concentration of precipitation that currently exists in an area.
