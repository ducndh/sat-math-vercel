SAT PRACTICE PLATFORM - HANDOFF CONTEXT
=====================================
Date: August 22, 2025
Project: SAT Math Practice Platform (Vercel deployment)

CURRENT STATUS:
âœ… COMPLETED TASKS:
- Updated ALL API routes from Vercel KV to Vercel Blob storage
- Created comprehensive image requirements analysis tool
- Identified 42 questions across 4 tests that need images (11% of total)
- Upload script is ready and compatible with current architecture

ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS:
- Need to upload 4 test files to Vercel Blob (requires env setup)
- Need to test rendering on website

ðŸ“‹ TEST FILES TO UPLOAD:
1. June 2025 US 1.txt (95 questions, 14 need images)
2. June 2025 US 2.txt (98 questions, 7 need images) 
3. March 2025 US 1.txt (95 questions, 9 need images)
4. May 2025 INT 1.txt (98 questions, 12 need images)

KEY ARCHITECTURE CHANGE:
- Switched from Vercel KV to Vercel Blob for ALL data storage
- Tests stored as: tests/{testId}.json
- Results stored as: results/{resultId}.json
- Updated routes: /api/test/[testId], /api/admin/create-test, /api/test/submit, etc.

NEXT STEPS NEEDED:
1. Set up Vercel environment (vercel login, vercel env pull)
2. Run: node scripts/upload-tests.js
3. Test website rendering of uploaded tests
4. Verify all 4 tests work correctly

TOOLS AVAILABLE:
- scripts/upload-tests.js - uploads all 4 tests to Blob
- scripts/analyze-image-requirements.js - lists missing images
- Enhanced parser handles the structured test format

CRITICAL: The upload script is ready but needs Vercel CLI setup first.
All API routes have been updated to use Blob storage instead of KV.
