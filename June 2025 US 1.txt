PASSAGE:::
Text 1
Uisdean Nicholson and his team have discovered evidence in seismic data of a 40-kilometer-wide subsurface crater beneath nearly a kilometer of water off the coast of West Africa that is consistent with a 400-meter-wide asteroid striking the seafloor. This structure, which the team named Nadir, exhibits all the telltale signs of a high-velocity impact crater: an elevated rim, a circular shape, a terraced floor, and a pronounced area of uplift at its center.
Text 2
Both carbonate dissolution and subsurface salt withdrawal can cause craterlike depressions without the need for a high-velocity impact. However, carbonate dissolution is very unlikely to have occurred in the vicinity of Nadir, and although subsurface salt withdrawal could have plausibly occurred in this area and would result in a depression with a terraced floor or a circular shape, it would not exhibit the area of central uplift seen at Nadir.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which choice best describes a difference between the approach of Text 1 and the approach of Text 2?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) Text 1 dispassionately describes Nicholson and colleagues' findings and conclusions, whereas Text 2 attempts to convey the researchers' excitement on discovering Nadir.
OPTION::: B) Text 1 focuses on features Nadir lacks, whereas Text 2 indicates features it shares with other geological depressions.
OPTION::: C) Text 1 discusses a single plausible cause of Nadir, whereas Text 2 evaluates two possible causes.
OPTION::: D) Text 1 emphasizes the evidence supporting an asteroid impact as the cause of Nadir, whereas Text 2 argues against that explanation.

PASSAGE::: The following text is from Julia Alvarez's 2000 novel In the Name of Salomé. The narrator and her sister, daughters of a famous poet, are being tutored by Alejandro Román.
Our tutor, Alejandro Román, brought his younger brother, Miguel, to class one day. By now I was eighteen and had learned everything Alejandro had to teach me, so I was glad for a new face. Miguel was an aspiring poet, and he had heard from his brother that the Ureña girls were none other than the daughters of Nicolás Ureña, and they were smart as clockwork. Miguel was hoping not only to meet us but to make the acquaintance of the poet himself at Mamá's house.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Based on the text, why does Miguel accompany his brother to the sisters' house one day?

QUESTION_NUMBER::: 9
PASSAGE::: Motivated to sell as many paintings as possible, Alfred Hair, an influential figure among the landscape artists known as the Florida Highwaymen, pioneered "fast painting," which in part involved working across multiple canvasses at once. That many of Hair's acolytes, including Isaac Knight, imitated the technique accounts in part for the impressionistic qualities that are now synonymous with the group's shared aesthetic. But not all Highwaymen fully embraced this approach; for instance, though Willie Reagan was also prolific, his paintings were executed with greater attention to detail.
QUESTION_TEXT::: What does the text most strongly suggest about paintings by Knight?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) Because of the manner in which they were created, they likely have visual qualities that are regarded as more typical of Florida Highwaymen paintings than the qualities in works by Reagan.
OPTION::: B) Although it is evident that Knight adopted some of Hair's preferred techniques, Knight's works are less derivative of works by Hair than is typically acknowledged.
OPTION::: C) The lack of precision with which they were executed suggests that they are inferior to works by either Hair or Reagan.
OPTION::: D) Knight's reliance on the technique of fast painting likely accounts for his works being more aesthetically interesting than works by Reagan are.

QUESTION_NUMBER::: 10
PASSAGE::: Vancouver has high pedestrian traffic, but other cities cannot increase their pedestrian traffic simply by replicating a single feature of Vancouver—e.g., its high number of pedestrian amenities—that is associated with walkability. As urbanist Mariela Alfonzo argues, many factors influence people's decision-making about whether to walk: some studies have shown the importance of demographic characteristics, others have shown the importance of average commuting distance, and so on, and it is clear that none of these factors in isolation fully explains pedestrian habits in a given city.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Based on the text, the author would most likely agree with which statement about Vancouver's "high number of pedestrian amenities"?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) It may increase walkability in Vancouver, but it is known to reduce walkability in other cities.
OPTION::: B) It is better understood as an effect of the high level of pedestrian traffic in Vancouver than as a cause of that pedestrian traffic.
OPTION::: C) It affects walking decisions in Vancouver less than demographic characteristics and average commuting distance do.
OPTION::: D) It should be understood as just one of several factors that influence pedestrian activity in Vancouver.

PASSAGE::: Many plants have leaves that are larger on one side of their long central axis than the other, a phenomenon known as asymmetrical orientation. University of California, Berkeley biologist Ciera Martinez and colleagues examined several species of grapevine and closely related plants, which have leaves that grow in pairs, to see if both leaves in a pair tend to be oriented toward the same side (that is, have more tissue on the same side) or not. They found that opposite-side orientation was much more common than same-side orientation; in the Amur grape, for example, approximately [BLANK]

QUESTION_NUMBER::: 14
PASSAGE::: Mooseberry (Viburnum edule) plants are native to Alaska, where harsh conditions have historically impeded potential invasive species. As the boreal climate has warmed in recent decades, however, common knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare) plants have established themselves in Alaska. It has been suggested that warming-induced delays in the onset of subfreezing temperatures in autumn can benefit invasives more than native species; to evaluate this possibility, biologists Christa Mulder and Katie Spellman tracked V. edule and P. aviculare, along with other native and invasive species, over several years, concluding that invasives are advantaged by delays in subfreezing temperature onset in Alaska.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which finding, if true, would most directly support Mulder and Spellman's conclusion?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) Although V. edule and P. aviculare both tended to produce leaves later into autumn in years with late subfreezing temperature onset, the extension was much greater for P. aviculare than for V. edule.
OPTION::: B) Although significant interannual variations in subfreezing temperature onset were observed during the study, neither P. aviculare nor V. edule showed any significant interannual variation in the cessation of leaf production.
OPTION::: C) Although V. edule and P. aviculare tended to stop producing leaves at about the same time in years with historically typical temperature patterns, P. aviculare stopped producing leaves sooner than V. edule did in years with late subfreezing temperature onset.
OPTION::: D) Although V. edule and P. aviculare both tended to produce more leaves overall in years with late subfreezing temperature onset than they did in years with historically typical temperature patterns, the years with late subfreezing temperature onset also had early growing season onset in spring.

PASSAGE::: In Algeria, use of solid fuel (e.g., coal, wood) as a share of total household fuel use fell by approximately three-fourths between 2000 and 2019; such shifts are often explained by appeal to the energy ladder, a model holding that fuel choice is mediated mainly by household income (specifically, high-technology fuels displace solid fuels as incomes rise). Rasmus Heltberg's study of fuel use in Ghana shows this model to be reductive, however: household fuel use was heterogeneous, flexible, and influenced by several factors, including the stability of the local electrical grid.

PASSAGE::: In a study by Mika R. Moran, Daniel A. Rodriguez, and colleagues, residents of La Paz, Bolivia, and Fortaleza, Brazil, were surveyed about parks in their cities. Of the 528 respondents from La Paz, 67.5% indicated that they use the city's parks, and of the 938 respondents from Fortaleza, 35.7% indicated using city parks. Given that the percentage of La Paz respondents who reported living within a 10-minute walk of a park was much lower than that reported by Fortaleza respondents, greater proximity alone can't explain the difference in park use.

PASSAGE::: The bird species Hylophilus ochraceiceps (the tawny-crowned greenlet) shares some territory in French Guiana with Thamnomanes caesius (the cinereous antshrike), which emits a loud alarm call when it detects predators. Biologist Ari Martinez and colleagues recorded T. caesius alarm calls and played them in the vicinity of wild H. ochraceiceps. Finding that the birds often froze in place or scattered into vegetation upon hearing the calls, they concluded that H. ochraceiceps associates T. caesius alarm calls with danger.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which finding, if true, would most directly support Martinez and colleagues' conclusion?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) When Martínez and colleagues played control sounds of random noise in the vicinity of H. ochraceiceps, the birds displayed no reaction.
OPTION::: B) Other bird species than H. ochraceiceps also showed a tendency to freeze in place or scatter into vegetation when Martinez and colleagues played T. caesius alarm calls.
OPTION::: C) Martínez and colleagues played alarm calls from different T. caesius individuals and observed no significant variation in the responses of H. ochraceiceps.
OPTION::: D) In some instances, H. ochraceiceps froze in place or scattered into vegetation when Martínez and colleagues approached but before they began playing sounds.

PASSAGE::: Apple's introduction of the iPhone in 2007 is a quintessential instance of brand extension—the company leveraged its brand recognition as a computer manufacturer to enter a product category where it had not previously competed. An outstanding question is whether perceived category similarity predicts consumers' likelihood of purchasing brand extensions. To answer this question, Alicia Grasby et al. identified 30 extended-brand pairs (e.g., the same brand of laundry detergent and air freshener) in 52 weeks of purchases by approximately 60,000 households and, for each pair, calculated the change in probability of a brand in one category being purchased if the same brand was purchased in the other category.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Based on the text, which potential study design would be most likely to produce evidence that would enable Grasby et al. to answer their research question?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) Have a representative sample of the households rate the similarity of the product categories in each extended-brand pair; then determine how, if at all, those ratings correlate with the change in probability that the team calculated for each pair.
OPTION::: B) Have a representative sample of the households rate the similarity of one product in each extended-brand pair to other products in the same category, then determine how, if at all, those ratings correlate with the change in probability that the team calculated for each pair.
OPTION::: C) Poll a representative sample of the households to determine the degree of brand recognition for each brand in the extended-brand pairs, then determine how, if at all, the degree of brand recognition correlates with the frequency with which a different group of households purchased at least one product of that brand.
OPTION::: D) Poll a representative sample of the households to determine the degree of brand recognition of each brand in the extended-brand pairs, then determine how, if at all, the degree of brand recognition correlates with the average cost of each product in the pairs.

PASSAGE::: In 1900, in collaboration with Cherokee cultural historian Will West Long, white ethnographer James Mooney assembled a collection of traditional oral stories related to him by Cherokee elders. Based on their content, Mooney categorized them into various genres: historical traditions, tales of animals, and so on. Noting that some stories feature detailed descriptions of geographic locations in the Cherokee homeland, Mooney demarcated those as a genre he referred to as "wonder stories." While Long and Mooney's collaboration proved valuable as an act of cultural preservation, it is important to bear in mind that Cherokee people are not known to have applied genre divisions to their stories before Mooney's work. There is, therefore, [BLANK]
