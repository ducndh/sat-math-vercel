To Margaret the station of King's Cross had always suggested infinity. Its very situation—withdrawn a little behind the facile splendours of St. Pancras—implied a comment on the materialism of life. Those two great arches, colourless, indifferent, shouldering between them an unlovely clock, were fit portals for some eternal adventure, whose issue might be prosperous, but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity.
Text 2
The interplay between opposing ideological positions in Howards End is broadly articulated in the novel's organization of geographic space. On the one hand, the modern metropolis of London represents capitalism's emphasis on pragmatism and the accumulation of material wealth; on the other, the English countryside, accessible via King's Cross, fosters an idealism that values tradition, authentic personal connection, and the aesthetic—what the novel calls "the infinite."
QUESTION_TEXT::: Based on the texts, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about King's Cross, as it is depicted in Text 1?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) As a point of connection between London and the countryside, King's Cross suggests to Margaret the possibility of acquiring the intangible abundance promised by the kinds of authentic engagements that the novel's rural spaces seem to offer.
OPTION::: B) Because it is situated at the beginning of Margaret's journey from the city to the country, King's Cross emblematizes the intrusion of the forces of materialism and modernity into the rural spaces that the novel associates with idealism and tradition.
OPTION::: C) The austerity conveyed by King's Cross's appearance mirrors Margaret's disillusionment with the prospect of having authentic connections with other people in a world that chiefly values more conventional forms of prosperity.
OPTION::: D) King's Cross has a relatively unassuming appearance whose sharp contrast with the more aesthetically pleasing appearance of St. Pancras suggests to Margaret the ascendancy of the pragmatic capitalistic outlook among London's inhabitants.

PASSAGE::: Though John Crowley, author of Engine Summer, is perhaps not as well known as the most commercially successful American writers of the past fifty years, his work has had several influential champions, including the poet John Hollander and the literary critic Harold Bloom. According to journalist Graeme Wood, Bloom claimed to have read Crowley's novel Little, Big at least forty-six times, and in his posthumously published afterword to a 2022 edition of the book, Bloom rhetorically asked: "How many living authors of prose romance are universally relevant? Only Crowley."

PASSAGE::: Some scientists have suggested that as ocean temperatures rise, many fish and corals found in the shallow zone (less than 30 meters below the surface) could take refuge in the cooler, darker mesophotic zone (30 to 150 meters below the surface). However, it isn't clear that all such species will be able to tolerate mesophotic conditions.

Based on the depths at which those corals are now found, the species that seems least suited to a full migration to the mesophotic zone is [BLANK]

PASSAGE::: Rafael Núñez and colleagues studied how members of the Yupno, an Indigenous group in Papua New Guinea, conceptualize time in both spoken language and gestures. The researchers recorded Yupno speakers explaining certain temporal words and phrases, such as jare, a past-oriented expression that translates to "day before yesterday," and coded each speaker's manual gestures. Previous research has found a tendency in many cultures to map temporal distinctions along an imagined linear axis; for instance, Hebrew speakers often refer to the right-left axis to describe events in time. Some researchers believe this tendency is universal, but Núñez and colleagues claim this is not the case.
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which finding, if true, would most directly support Núñez and colleagues' claim?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) Yupno speakers typically use their left hand to make temporal gestures regardless of whether the gestures are past oriented or future oriented.
OPTION::: B) Future-oriented gestures used by Yupno speakers do not, on average, point in the opposite linear direction of past-oriented gestures.

A newly designed piezoelectric harvester incorporating a highly conductive carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) electrode has been shown to provide steady energy loads during resonance, an absolute prerequisite for wireless communication devices to be powered piezoelectrically.

PASSAGE::: Like many other genera of wild bees, bumblebees have in recent decades experienced population collapse caused by, among other factors, habitat destruction and climate variation. Bumblebees are also one of the most researched bee genera, second only to honeybees. As a result, ecologists have gained much of their insight about wild-bee declines from bumblebees. In a 2021 paper, zoologist Guilhaume Ghisbain notes that among the relatively few wild-bee genera that display social behaviour and dietary generalism (ability to obtain nectar and pollen from a diversity of plant species), two traits that are associated with increased resilience to some specific environmental changes, Ghisbain therefore contends that [BLANK]
QUESTION_TEXT::: Which choice most logically completes the text?
OPTIONS_START
OPTION::: A) because bumblebees and other bees with generalist diets are less negatively affected by environmental stress than bees with specialized diets are, they are less likely to experience major population changes in the future than bees with specialized diets are.
OPTION::: B) although bumblebees have been more extensively studied than most wild bees, researchers should not use bumblebees to draw conclusions about the decline of other wild bees, even ones with feeding patterns and levels of sociability that are similar to those of bumblebees.
OPTION::: C) although bumblebees and many other wild bees have experienced similar population declines in the past, compared with other wild bees, bumblebees are likely at greater risk of being harmed by climate variation than by habitat destruction.
OPTION::: D) because the responses of bumblebees and other wild bees to environmental threats are not always comparable, researchers need to exercise caution when extrapolating information about wild-bee population declines from bumblebees.

PASSAGE::: Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) capitalize on the ability of some species of bacteria to metabolize metal, liberating electrons. The bacteria form a dense biofilm on the surface of an electron-collecting anode, but moving the electrons from the bacterial cytoplasm to an external electrode requires that the electrons pass through a series of inefficient oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. Accordingly, MFC power output rarely exceeds a density of 0.30 milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm²). In an experiment, researchers added silver nanoparticles to carbon paper covering the anode in an MFC. The resulting power density was 0.66 mW/cm². Since metals such as silver exhibit high electrical conductivity, the researchers hypothesized that [BLANK]

* Step 1: Ultraviolet (UV) light images are projected up into a pool of liquid resin, where the object's first layer takes shape.
* Step 2: The partially cured resin object is raised, leaving a thin space (a "dead zone") beneath it for oxygen and liquid resin to flow through.
* Step 3: The UV light passes through the dead zone—maintaining the flow of resin—and partially cures additional layers of the object.
